## Methodology

Two layers of measurement:

1. **Cyrius `bench` micro** — `tests/anuenue.bcyr`. Per-call cost of
   the two hot-path primitives (`hsv_rainbow` and `tty_fg_rgb_buf`)
   measured with `lib/bench.cyr`'s batched-clock harness (1M iter
   per batch — keeps total wall-time well past the ~120ns
   `clock_gettime` overhead floor).
2. **End-to-end shell** — `cat <fixture> | anuenue > /dev/null` vs
   `cat <fixture> > /dev/null`, measured with shell `time` over
   three runs. The fixture is `base64`-of-1MB-`/dev/urandom` — a
   `~1.4MB` ASCII corpus, no LF compression, all printable bytes.
   *(M1 captures this manually; M5 — perf pass — will scriptize.)*

Host: `archaemenid`-class workstation (AMD Zen, Linux 7.0.x, glibc
n/a — Cyrius bypasses libc).

## v0.2.0 — M1 baseline (2026-05-21)

First end-to-end measurement on the pipe-purity proof. No perf work
yet; the M5 milestone (v0.6.0) will iterate against this baseline.

### Micro

| Primitive             | Avg (ns/call) | Min  | Max  | Iters  |
|-----------------------|---------------|------|------|--------|
| `hsv_rainbow`         |  8            |  8   |  8   | 1M     |
| `tty_fg_rgb_buf`      | 45            | 45   | 45   | 1M     |

Per-character formatting (escape emission) costs ~5.6× the HSV
computation. Not surprising — `_ansi_emit_u8` runs three times per
escape (one per channel) and each invocation does a divide/modulus
chain. M5 candidates: pre-computed 256-entry decimal-byte LUT for
channel encoding; SIMD-batched escape emission once a corpus of
"typical rainbow input" is large enough to justify it.

### End-to-end

Input: `base64 < /dev/urandom` truncated to **1 416 501 bytes** —
pure-ASCII, no embedded LFs at the line-buffer boundary, all bytes
get the truecolor prefix.

| Pipeline                              | Wall (s, mean of 3) | User | Sys  |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------|------|
| `cat fixture > /dev/null`             | 0.013               | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| `anuenue < fixture > /dev/null`       | 0.087               | 0.08 | 0.00 |

- **Per-byte overhead**: `(0.087 − 0.013) / 1 416 501 ≈ 53 ns/byte`
- **Output expansion**: `24 660 228 / 1 416 501 ≈ 17.4×` — every
  input byte produces ~17 bytes of fg-escape + the payload byte +
  per-line reset overhead. Matches the worst-case envelope
  `_ansi_emit_u8` + framing (19 max, 13–17 typical) plus a 4-byte
  reset every line.

### Notes

- `hsv_rainbow`'s 8ns is below `clock_gettime`'s per-call overhead;
  the batched harness is the only way to measure it accurately.
- The end-to-end measurement is dominated by `tty_fg_rgb_buf`
  (the 45ns × ~1.4M = ~64ms accounted of the ~74ms anuenue-only
  delta vs cat). The remaining ~10ms is the filter-loop overhead
  (read syscalls, branch dispatch, write syscalls — 32KB flushes,
  so ~43 write(2) calls for 1.4MB input).
- DCE was NOT applied to the M1 binary. Re-measure with
  `CYRIUS_DCE=1 cyrius build ...` at the M5 perf pass.

## v0.4.0 — M3 (UTF-8 grapheme awareness)

Cluster classification adds per-codepoint work even on pure ASCII:
`utf8_seq_len` + `cp_is_extending` (range checks) + RI/ZWJ latch
updates. The ASCII path slows ~55% vs v0.3.0; multi-byte input
benefits from one-fg-per-codepoint amortisation but still pays the
classification cost.

### End-to-end

Same 1 416 501-byte base64-ASCII corpus from v0.2.0:

| Pipeline                              | Wall (s, mean of 3) | vs v0.3.0 |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| `cat fixture > /dev/null`             | 0.013               | (same)    |
| `anuenue < fixture > /dev/null`       | 0.135               | +55%      |

- **ASCII per-byte overhead**: `(0.135 − 0.013) / 1 416 501 ≈ 86 ns/byte`
  (vs 53 ns at v0.3.0 — 33 ns/byte cluster-classification cost).
- **UTF-8 corpus** (`AGNOS Привет 日本 🌈 rainbow ` × 1000 = 39 000
  bytes): 3 ms / ~77 ns per input byte. Multi-byte codepoints
  amortise the per-cluster work over their 2–4 payload bytes —
  the per-byte cost is comparable to the ASCII path despite the
  cluster overhead, because one fg escape now covers 2–4 bytes of
  payload (vs ASCII's 1 byte / escape).

### Binary

- **0.4.0 DCE size**: **322 368 bytes** (~315 KB). +5 152 bytes
  over v0.3.0 for the UTF-8 + grapheme-classification surface.

## v0.6.0 — M5 (perf pass)

Three layered optimisations against the M3 regression. ASCII
short-circuit skips the UTF-8 + cluster classifier on the common
case. `cp_is_extending` binary-searches a sorted range table.
And — the biggest win — a 1 530-entry phase-cached escape table
collapses `hsv_rainbow + tty_fg_rgb_buf` into a single memcpy.

Result: the ASCII hot path drops below v0.3.0's pre-cluster floor.
UTF-8 mixed comes in even faster, because the cluster work
amortises over multi-byte payloads and the escape pre-computation
skips digit encoding on every cluster.

### End-to-end (scripts/perf-bench.sh, RUNS=7 median)

Three corpora at ~1.4 MB each, on the same host the prior baselines
ran on:

| Corpus           | cat (ms) | anuenue (ms) | Overhead (ns/byte) | Δ vs v0.5.0 |
|------------------|----------|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| ascii (no LF)    | 3        | 68           | **47.0**           | −48.7%      |
| ascii (w/ LFs)   | 3        | 73           | 51.0               | −46.3%      |
| utf8 mixed       | 3        | 62           | 43.0               | −35.1%      |

### Per-optimisation contribution (ascii no-LF)

| Step                                       | ns/byte | Δ      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| v0.5.0 baseline                            | 91.6    | —      |
| + ASCII short-circuit                      | 59.3    | −32.3  |
| + `cp_is_extending` binary-search LUT      | 60.0    | +0.7*  |
| + phase-cached escape buffer (M5 final)    | 47.0    | −13.0  |

\* The LUT is perf-neutral on the ASCII corpus (already short-
circuited); the +0.7 ns is host noise. UTF-8-heavy corpora with
Arabic / Hebrew / math-zone combiners are where the LUT pays
back — log₂(21) ≈ 5 comparisons replacing a 21-condition linear
chain. Kept regardless: clearer code, future-proof.

### Binary

- **0.6.0 DCE size**: **335 160 bytes** (~327 KB). +1 040 bytes
  over v0.5.0 for the new `_phase_esc_init` / `_emit_phase_esc`
  helpers, the `cp_is_extending` LUT init body, and the
  binary-search loop. The 48 KB phase-cache table is heap-
  allocated at first filter/animate entry and doesn't show
  up in the DCE binary.
- M5 acceptance cap: 350 KB → comfortably under (−14 840 B
  headroom for M6 color-mode work).

### Notes

- `perf-bench.sh` is the M5 ratchet from here forward. Each
  minor cut should re-run it; CHANGELOG records any motion in
  the per-byte figures.
- The phase-cached escape table is a runtime alloc of
  `1530 × 32 = 48 960` bytes (heap); it amortises over the
  filter run — at the M3 baseline of ~13M chars/sec, that's
  3.8 μs of table-fill cost per million bytes filtered, or
  3.8 ns/byte at the limit. Already counted in the median
  ns/byte figures above.

## Trend

| Release | Per-byte ASCII (ns) | hsv_rainbow (ns) | tty_fg_rgb_buf (ns) | DCE size (B) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| v0.2.0  | 53                  | 8                | 45                  | 304 368      |
| v0.3.0  | 53*                 | 8                | 45                  | 317 216      |
| v0.4.0  | 86                  | 8                | 45                  | 322 368      |
| v0.5.0  | 92†                 | 8                | 45                  | 334 120      |
| v0.6.0  | **47**              | 8                | 45                  | 335 160      |

\* v0.3.0 added flag-parsing at startup but the filter hot path
was unchanged; per-byte cost stayed flat.

† v0.5.0 figure captured by perf-bench.sh on the M5 cut host
(slightly slower than the v0.4.0 86 ns/byte doc number — both
numbers are within host-variance bounds of each other; the M5
acceptance was scoped against the v0.4.0 floor as the regression
to recover).
